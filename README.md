This repository contains the source code for the paper. If you have Inkscape
and the TeX live packages installed you can build it as follows:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/softdevteam/rustgc_paper
cd rustgc_paper && make
```

This will create a PDF file called `rustgc_paper.pdf` in the repository's top
level directory.
